Twisted Python OpenTSDB Client
==============================

A simple client for sending metrics to an OpenTSDB
instance. OpenTSDB is a time series database that
never downsamples metrics and provides and
extremely fast metrics graphing engine. More
information is available at opentsdb.net

Usage
=====

See example.py for an example usage. The module,
totsdb.py, exposes SendMetric(), which takes
a hostname:port string for the OpenTSDB instance
and a list of metric dictionaries.

Tested with Twisted Python 11.0.
